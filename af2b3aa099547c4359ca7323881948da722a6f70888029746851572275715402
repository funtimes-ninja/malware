#### AAC Config (Generated by AAC 3.3.0)
#
# NOTE: Most of the values here have been tried and tested to work.
#       It is not recommended that you change them unless you are
#       getting false positives.
#
#       It would be a good idea to make sure the false positives you're getting aren't actually hackers....

#      - "broadcast {player} was kicked for hacking"
