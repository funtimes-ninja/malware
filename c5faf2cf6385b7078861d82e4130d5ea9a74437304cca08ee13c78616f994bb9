# EZRanksLite multiplier.yml file
# This file allows you to create custom cost multipliers and discounts
# Discounts need to be listed in the rankup_cost_discounts: section
# Multipliers need to be listed in the rankup_cost_multipliers section
# 
# The format for a multiplier and discount is the same:
# <unique identifier>:
#   priority: <unique number>
#   permission: <your custom permission for this multiplier/discount>
#   percentage: <your percentage to add on/take off of the cost>
# 
# You can list as many multipliers/discounts you like for each section.
# Each multiplier/discount must have a unique priority set!!!
# The priority determines what multiplier comes first in your list
# If a player happens to have multiple discount or multiplier
# permissions, the lowest priority will always be applied
# 
# The percentage system works just like a discount at a store...
# If you set a discount percentage to 99.0 for a rank that cost 100 dollarsanyone with that discount permission will only pay 1 dollar
# The format for percentage can include a decimal ex: 1.25, 99.9, 1, 1.05
# DO NOT INCLUDE A % SYMBOL!!!
# Discounts can not exceed a 100% percentage, 
# if your discount makes the rankup cost negative
# the price will default to 1
# You can set multipliers to any percentage: 400.0, 200.0 etc 
# If a player has permission for a cost multiplier and discount, the multiplier will always be applied before the discount
# is applied. Meaning: player has a multiplier to make ranking up cost twice as much and has perm for discount
# The discount will be applied to the new cost AFTER the multiplier is applied.
